# Basic Arithmetic Operations Console Application

A simple Java console application that performs basic arithmetic operations. Users can choose from a variety of operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two or three numbers. This program demonstrates the use of overloaded methods, conditional statements, and user inputs, which might be beneficial for those just starting out with Java programming.

## Project Description

This application provides a simple interface for users to perform basic arithmetic operations using predefined options. Depending on the user's choice, they can add, subtract, multiply, or divide two or three numbers. The program uses overloaded methods to handle different numbers of operands, making it a useful tool for learning about method overloading, conditionals, and handling input in Java.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Supports operations on both two and three numbers.
- User-friendly console interface with numbered options.
- Utilizes method overloading to perform arithmetic operations.
